# CS408 - M11 Lab: Client-side web APIs

## Overview

The goal of module 11's was to understand how a webpage's frontend can connect to its backend by building a inventory management application using AWS and HTML/CSS/JS. This lab builds upon module 10's lab and the backend we set up. The simple inventory app allows users to load all items in the database, delete an item and add a new item

## How to run code

- To run the code open up a new git bash terminal and cd to the folder were you want to copy the repository to

  `cd path/to/your/directory`

- Once in the desired folder use the command git clone to copy the repo there

  `git clone https://github.com/tonyhdz24/cs408-lab-11-tonyhdz24`
